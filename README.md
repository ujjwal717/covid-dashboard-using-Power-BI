# covid-dashboard-using-Power-BI
It is a covid-19 dashboard that has various covid related information and is created using Power BI. This dashboard focused on the covid data of Indian citizens.

The dataset has been downloaded from kaggle and I have attached it in this repo as well.
I have also cleaned and pre-processed data a bit as well in Power BI (I used Power BI only as the main focus of the project was to do everything in Power BI).

The Various tiles in the dashboard are :-

1) Card showing total population
2) Card showing total cases
3) Card showing total cured
4) Card showing total deaths
5) Slicer to select different states
6) Pie Chart for states with maximum population
7) Bar chart showing 5 states with maximum death percentage
8) Line chart with different vaccine percentages for dose 1 and dose 2 for different states
